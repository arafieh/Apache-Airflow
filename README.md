## Project: Data Pipelines with Airflow

### Introduction
***
A music streaming company, Sparkify, has decided that it is time to introduce more automation and monitoring to their data warehouse ETL pipelines and come to the conclusion that the best tool to achieve this is Apache Airflow. Their data resides in S3 and needs to be processed in Sparkify's data warehouse in Amazon Redshif. The source datasets consist of JSON logs that tell about user activity in the application and JSON metadata about the songs the users listen to.

For this subject, a path to create high grade data pipelines that are dynamic and built from reusable tasks, can be monitored, and allow easy backfills, needed to be planned. Data quality plays a big part when analyses are executed on top the data warehouse, so tests will run against company datasets after the ETL steps have been executed to catch any discrepancies in the datasets.

### Project Overview
***

This project use Apache Airflow. In project custom operators used to perform tasks such as staging the data, filling the data warehouse, and running checks on the data as the final step.
Following digram shows DAG schema:

### Datasets
*** 

For this project, there are two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:

Here are S3 links for data sets:

Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data

Log data json path: s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json


### Data Model
***

<p>Following schema shows data model for Sparkify data. As shown in trhe model, it has one "Fact Table" and four "Dimentional Tables".<br>
The relation type between dimentional tables and fact table are one to many.</p>

### Fact Table
1. **songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
    - *songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent*

### Dimension Tables
2. **users** - users in the app
    - *user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level*
3. **songs** - songs in music database
    - *song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration*
4. **artists** - artists in music database
    - *artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude*
5. **time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
    - *start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday*


### Song Dataset
***

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

### Log Dataset
***

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by an event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

Each JSON has the following columns of data:

artist,auth, firstName, gender, itemInSession, lastName, length, level, location, method, page, registration, sessionId, song, status, ts, userAgent, userId

### Building the operators
***

For this project, four different operators has been built that stage the data, transform the data, and run checks on data quality.

All of the operators and task instances will run SQL statements against the Redshift database. However, using parameters wisely will allow developer to build flexible, reusable, and configurable operators that can later apply to many kinds of data pipelines with Redshift and with other databases.

#### Stage Operator
***

The stage operator is expected to be able to load any JSON formatted files from S3 to Amazon Redshift. The operator creates and runs a SQL COPY statement based on the parameters provided. The operator's parameters should specify where in S3 the file is loaded and what is the target table.

The parameters should be used to distinguish between JSON file. Another important requirement of the stage operator is containing a templated field that allows it to load timestamped files from S3 based on the execution time and run backfills.

#### Fact and Dimension Operators
***
The operator is expected to take as input a SQL statement and target database on which to run the query against. A target table has been defined that will contain the results of the transformation.

Dimension loads are often done with the truncate-insert pattern where the target table is emptied before the load. This allowe have a parameter that  switching between insert modes when loading dimensions. Fact tables are usually so massive that they should only allow append type functionality.

#### Data Quality Operator
***
The final operator to create is the data quality operator, which is used to run checks on the data itself. The operator's main functionality is to receive one or more SQL based test cases along with the expected results and execute the tests. For each the test, the test result and expected result needs to be checked and if there is no match, the operator should raise an exception and the task should retry and fail eventually.

For example one test could be a SQL statement that checks if certain column contains NULL values by counting all the rows that have NULL in the column. We do not want to have any NULLs so expected result would be 0 and the test would compare the SQL statement's outcome to the expected result.
